NAME

git-interpret-trailers - Add or parse structured information in commit messages

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git interpret-trailers' [--in-place] [--trim-empty]
			[(--trailer (<key>|<keyAlias>)[(=|:)<value>])...]
			[--parse] [<file>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Add or parse 'trailer' lines that look similar to RFC 822 e-mail
headers, at the end of the otherwise free-form part of a commit
message. For example, in the following commit message

------------------------------------------------
subject

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Signed-off-by: Alice <alice@example.com>
Signed-off-by: Bob <bob@example.com>
------------------------------------------------

the last two lines starting with "Signed-off-by" are trailers, and are part of a
"trailer block".

This command reads commit messages from either the
<file> arguments or the standard input if no <file> is specified.
If `--parse` is specified, the output consists of the parsed trailers
coming from the input, without influencing them with any command line
options or configuration variables.

Otherwise, this command applies `trailer.*` configuration variables
(which could potentially add new trailers, as well as replace existing ones),
as well as any command line arguments that can override configuration
variables (such as `--trailer=...` which could also add new trailers),
to each input file. The result is emitted on the standard output.

This command can also operate on the output of linkgit:git-format-patch[1],
which is more elaborate than a plain commit message. Namely, such output
includes a commit message (as above), a "---" divider line, and a patch part.
For these inputs, the divider and patch parts are not modified by
this command and are emitted as is on the output, unless
`--no-divider` is specified.

Some configuration variables control the way the `--trailer` arguments
are applied to each input and the way any existing trailer in
the input is changed. They also make it possible to
automatically add some trailers (see `trailer.ifmissing`).

By default, a '<key>=<value>' or '<key>:<value>' argument given
using `--trailer` will be appended after the existing trailers only if
the last trailer has a different (<key>, <value>) pair (or if there
is no existing trailer with the same <key>).
The <key> and <value> parts will be trimmed
to remove starting and trailing whitespace, and the resulting trimmed
<key> and <value> will appear in the output like this:

------------------------------------------------
key: value
------------------------------------------------

This means that the trimmed <key> and <value> will be separated by
`': '` (one colon followed by one space).

For convenience, a <keyAlias> can be configured to make using `--trailer`
shorter to type on the command line. This can be configured using the
'trailer.<keyAlias>.key' configuration variable. The <keyAlias> must be a prefix
of the full <key> string, although case sensitivity does not matter. For
example

------------------------------------------------
trailer.sign.key "Signed-off-by: "
------------------------------------------------

in your configuration specified a <key> of "Signed-off-by" and a <keyAlias> of
"sign", such that you only need to specify `--trailer="sign: foo"`
on the command line instead of `--trailer="Signed-off-by: foo"`.

By default, new trailers will be added at the end of the trailer block, assuming
that the trailer (the full "<key>: <value>" string) is missing from the block.
If it already exists at the bottom of the block, then the trailer will still be
added if adding it will not result in a duplicate line. If there was no trailer
block to begin with, ablank line will be added before the new
trailer if there isn't one already.

Existing trailers are extracted from the input by looking for
a group of one or more lines that (i) is all trailers, or (ii) contains at
least one Git-generated or user-configured trailer and consists of at
least 25% trailers.
The group must be preceded by one or more empty (or whitespace-only) lines.
The group must either be at the end of the input or be the last
non-whitespace lines before a line that starts with '---' (followed by a
space or the end of the line).

When reading trailers, there can be no whitespace before or inside the
<key>, but any number of regular space and tab characters are allowed
between the <key> and the separator. There can be whitespaces before,
inside or after the <value>. The <value> may be split over multiple lines
with each subsequent line starting with at least one whitespace, like
the "folding" in RFC 822. Example:

------------------------------------------------
key: This is a very long value, with spaces and
  newlines in it.
------------------------------------------------

Note that trailers do not follow (nor are they intended to follow) many of the
rules for RFC 822 headers. For example they do not follow the encoding rule.

OPTIONS
-------
--in-place::
	Edit the files in place.

--trim-empty::
	If the <value> part of any trailer contains only whitespace,
	the whole trailer will be removed from the output.
	This applies to existing trailers as well as new trailers.

--trailer (<key>|<keyAlias>)[(=|:)<value>]::
	Specify a (<key>, <value>) pair that should be applied as a
	trailer to the inputs. See the description of this
	command.

--where <placement>::
--no-where::
	For trailers provided with '--trailer', specify where they will be added.
	This setting overrides the `trailer.where` and any
	applicable `trailer.<keyAlias>.where` configuration variables
	for all subsequent '--trailer' options until the next occurrence of
	'--where' or '--no-where'. Upon encountering '--no-where', clear the
	effect of any previous use of '--where', such that the relevant configuration
	variables are no longer overridden for any remaining '--trailer' options.
	Possible placements are `after`, `before`, `end` or `start`.

--if-exists <action>::
--no-if-exists::
	For trailers provided with '--trailer', specify what action will be
	performed when there is already at
	least one trailer with the same <key> in the input.  This setting
	overrides the `trailer.ifExists` and any
	applicable `trailer.<keyAlias>.ifExists` configuration variables
	for all subsequent '--trailer' options until the next occurrence of
	'--if-exists' or '--no-if-exists'. Upon encountering '--no-if-exists, clear the
	effect of any previous use of '--if-exists', such that the relevant configuration
	variables are no longer overridden for any remaining '--trailer' options.
	Possible actions are `addIfDifferent`,
	`addIfDifferentNeighbor`, `add`, `replace` and `doNothing`.

--if-missing <action>::
--no-if-missing::
	For trailers provided with '--trailer', specify what action will be
	performed when there is no other
	trailer with the same <key> in the input.  This setting
	overrides the `trailer.ifMissing` and any
	applicable `trailer.<keyAlias>.ifMissing` configuration variables
	for all subsequent '--trailer' options until the next occurrence of
	'--if-missing' or '--no-if-missing'. Upon encountering '--no-if-missing',
	clear the effect of any previous use of '--if-missing', such that the relevant
	configuration variables are no longer overridden for any remaining
	'--trailer' options. Possible actions are `doNothing` or `add`.

--only-trailers::
	Output only the trailers, not any other parts of the input.

--only-input::
	Output only trailers that exist in the input; do not add any
	from the command-line or by applying `trailer.*` configuration
	variables.

--unfold::
	If a trailer has a value that runs over multiple lines (aka "folded"),
	reformat the value into a single line.

--parse::
	A convenience alias for `--only-trailers --only-input
	--unfold`. This makes it easier to only see the trailers coming from the
	input without influencing them with any command line options or
	configuration variables, while also making the output machine-friendly with
	--unfold.

--no-divider::
	Do not treat `---` as the end of the commit message. Use this
	when you know your input contains just the commit message itself
	(and not an email or the output of `git format-patch`).

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
-----------------------

trailer.separators::
	This option tells which characters are recognized as trailer
	separators. By default only ':' is recognized as a trailer
	separator, except that '=' is additionally accepted on the command
	line for compatibility with other git commands.
+
The first character given by this option will be the default character
used when another separator is not specified in the config for this
trailer.
+
For example, if the value for this option is "%=$", then only lines
using the format '<key><sep><value>' with <sep> containing '%', '='
or '$' and then spaces will be considered trailers. And '%' will be
the default separator used, so by default trailers will appear like:
'<key>% <value>' (one percent sign and one space will appear between
the key and the value).

trailer.where::
	Choose where new trailers will be added.
+
This can be `end`, which is the default, `start`, `after` or `before`.
+
If it is `end`, then new trailers will try to add themselves at the end of the
trailer block.
+
If it is `start`, then new trailers will try to add themselves at the start of
the trailer block.
+
If it is `after`, then new trailers will try to add themselves after another
(existing) trailer with the same <key>.
+
If it is `before`, then new trailers will try to add themselves just before
another (existing) trailer with the same <key>.

trailer.ifexists::
	Choose what to do when there is already an existing trailer with the
	same <key> in the input.
+
This can be `addIfDifferentNeighbor` (this
is the default), `addIfDifferent`, `add`, `replace` or `doNothing`.
+
With `addIfDifferentNeighbor`, a new trailer will be added only if no
trailer with the same (<key>, <value>) pair is above or below the line
where the new trailer will be added.
+
With `addIfDifferent`, a new trailer will be added only if no trailer
with the same (<key>, <value>) pair is already in the input.
+
With `add`, a new trailer will be added, even if some trailers with
the same (<key>, <value>) pair are already in the input.
+
With `replace`, an existing trailer with the same <key> will be
deleted and the new trailer will be added in its original location.
+
With `doNothing`, nothing will be done (no new trailer will be
added if there is already one with the same <key> in the input).

trailer.ifmissing::
	Choose what to do when there is no other trailer with the same
	<key> in the input.
+
This can be `add` (this is the default) or
`doNothing`.
+
With `add`, the trailer will be added.
+
With `doNothing`, nothing will be done.

trailer.<keyAlias>.key = <key>::
	Defines a <keyAlias> for the <key>. The <keyAlias> must be a
	prefix (case does not matter) of the <key>. For example, in `git
	config trailer.ack.key "Acked-by"` the "Acked-by" is the <key> and
	the "ack" is the <keyAlias>. This configuration allows the shorter
	`--trailer "ack:..."` invocation on the command line using the "ack"
	<keyAlias> instead of the longer `--trailer "Acked-by:..."`.
+
The <key> should end with a separator followed by one or more
space characters. By default the only valid separator is ':',
but this can be changed using the `trailer.separators` config
variable.
+
If there is a separator in the key, then it overrides the default
separator when adding the trailer.

trailer.<keyAlias>.where::
	This option takes the same values as the 'trailer.where'
	configuration variable and it overrides what is specified by
	that option for trailers with the specified <keyAlias>.

trailer.<keyAlias>.ifexists::
	This option takes the same values as the 'trailer.ifexists'
	configuration variable and it overrides what is specified by
	that option for trailers with the specified <keyAlias>.

trailer.<keyAlias>.ifmissing::
	This option takes the same values as the 'trailer.ifmissing'
	configuration variable and it overrides what is specified by
	that option for trailers with the specified <keyAlias>.

trailer.<keyAlias>.command::
	Deprecated in favor of 'trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd'.
	This option behaves the same way as 'trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd', except
	that it doesn't pass anything as an argument to the specified command.
	Instead the first occurrence of the substring "$ARG" in the specified
	command string is replaced by the
	<value> from '--trailer <keyAlias>=<value>'. And then the command is
	executed, with the final <value> of the resulting trailer coming from the
	STDOUT of the command.
+
Note that $ARG in the user's command is
only replaced once and that this replacement of "$ARG" is not safe (your command
may not be robust enough to handle it, depending on how you defined it).
+
When both 'trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd' and 'trailer.<keyAlias>.command' are defined
for the same <keyAlias>, 'trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd' is used and
'trailer.<keyAlias>.command' is ignored.

trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd::
	This option can be used to specify a shell command that will be called once
	to automatically add a trailer with the specified <keyAlias> as the <key>
	(if 'trailer.<keyAlias>.key = <key>' is not set). Then you can invoke it
	with '--trailer <keyAlias>=<value>', and the <value> will be passed into the
	command as the first argument, and the STDOUT ouput of that command will be
	used as the final <value> of the resulting trailer, with any leading and
	trailing whitespace trimmed off. This is especially useful if the <value>
	requires precision and you want to have some degree of confidence against
	typos.
