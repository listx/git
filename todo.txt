TODO

- make append_signoff() use the trailer API, instead of clumsily trying to use
  the iterator to perform business logic that the API already knows how to do.

- Make git-commit use the trailer API, instead of running
  interpret-trailers as a subprocess

- bug: git shortlog -ns '--group=trailer:signed-off-by' is empty (should
  be fixed by above knowledge of separators) if we define a
  "trailer.sign.key = 'Signed-off-by: '" because the entire
  "Signed-off-by: " string is read in as the key (same bug as above
  which we encountered when removing parsing of keys from the formatter)

  The (ugly) workaround is to use "git shortlog -ns
  '--group=trailer:signed-off-by: '" (with a ": " suffix).

  This bug should be fixed with the new space-aware config parsing. Add
  the breaking test before that commit and confirm that the change
  unbreaks that test.

- reduce the universe of possible separators to be ASCII in trailer.*
  configuration, just like we did in d3b3419f8f (config: tell the user that we
  expect an ASCII character, 2023-03-27).

- retire the _DEFAULT enums altogether (make these invalid states
  unrepresentable)

- doc: State that comment lines are always ignored, except the last
  comment line (because finding the end of the trailer block will never
  capture any trailing comment lines, resulting in the last comment line
  being treated as "the input after the trailer block", such that it
  still gets displayed)

  - Although ideally we'd just truncate away all comment lines instead of keeping
    the very last comment line while truncating earlier ones (seems
    unintuitive), this is a historical wart for old git behavior,
    captured in the 'with message that has an old style conflict block'
    test case from 3d24a7267d (trailer: add test with an old style
    conflict block, 2014-11-09).

- (fix this) add NEEDSWORK for starting the deprecation schedule for '.command'
  configuration option

  The main weird thing about this option is that it is assumed to be
  "independent" and always treated as if the user had specified
  "--trailer ..." for this key
  alias (get_independent_trailer_injectors_from(), which gets configured
  injectors with the .command option). But technically nothing stops
  '.cmd' from also being "independent" (it can also say "echo ..." which
  doesn't take any arguments).

  Instead, we should add a new flag like ".mode" which takes
  values like this:

    - manual: (default) only add this trailer if "--trailer foo" is given
    - always: always pretend that "--trailer foo" was given
    - auto: like always, but do nothing if "--trailer foo:bar" was
      given already by the user to avoid adding it twice

  Then from get_independent_trailer_injectors_from(), we can collect
  ".command" AND ".cmd" trailers (which have ".mode = always" or ".mode
  = auto")

- do any final renames (e.g., same_key() should be is_prefix_of() or
  similar_key())

- reorder all functions in trailer.{c,h} to be clearer (e.g., move all structs
  up to the top, colocate/group functions together).

- add Documentation/technical/trailer.txt to explain trailer parsing internals
  (explain the data structures and how the parser and formatter work), to help
  make the entire trailer.c implementation more readable. Explain all parsing
  rules and how trailer parsing works at the "single trailer" level
  (parse_trailer()) and multi-trailer (aka trailer block) level
  ("parse_trailer_block"). Authoritatively the 25% heuristic here and also how
  git_generated_prefixes are handled as pseudo-trailers (and what happens, for
  example, if users provide '--trailer "Signed-off-by: "' which exactly matches
  the prefix of a git_generated_prefix).

- (thought experiment): Gerrit currently encodes "Change-Id: ..." on its own
  separate line at the bottom of the log message, ignoring any existing trailer
  block. This behavior breaks our current trailer block parser, but we could
  make the trailer implementation able to optionally skip over blank lines if
  the next block is itself 25% trailers. Something to consider if we want to
  allow users to use interpret-trailers effectively with Gerrit.

- (housekeeping) see if GGG uses patience algorithm for generating patches for
  the list with /preview. If so, we can combine the "refactor and delete large
  chunks" patches together into one.

- add unit tests

- (feature?): git-commit: add config variable for automatically adding a signoff
  only if the original author's identity (name/email) matches the current user
  and if no such trailer already exists in the log message's trailer block (if
  any). This option already exists for format-patch, but sadly doesn't work for
  GitGitGadget users who don't use format-patch to send emails to the list.

- (feature?): git-commit: generalize the trailer block parser to be usable for
  not just trailers but all regions inside git-commit. Then git-commit can
  finally allow comment characters to appear at the beginning of the line in
  paragraphs. We could use the same sort of "25% heuristic" type of algorithm to
  say "this contiguous region of text is 95% non-comment lines, so treat all
  lines in this paragraph as text we want to include". The current behavior of
  interpreting the #12345 as a comment in the following commit message paragraph

    Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum. This commit fixes
    #12345 and #23456. Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum.
    Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum.

  (which IIRC results in deleting that entire line) is really annoying.

- (feature?) look at b05701c5b4c7983ef04d8c286c65089596553bd6. There, there was
  a trailer in the form

    [jc: ...
    ...
    ...
    ...]

  Consider allowing trailers with enclosing "earmuffs" like "[" and "]" or "("
  and ")" which is already used by "(cherry picked from commit ...)". The
  parsing rule could state that for such earmuffs, the right earmuff can only be
  terminated with a newline. This opens up a much more flexible description of
  trailers, whose parsing already depends on user configuration to help with the
  25% heuristic. Earmuffed trailers would make the folding rule more flexible
  --- any line, whether indented or not, would be part of the left-earmuffed
  line, as long as it's contiguous (no blank lines allowed, just like for
  non-earmuffed trailers).

  Doing this would probably make the "25% heuristic" cleaner, because then we
  would be able to encode all Git-generated trailers as regular trailer objects
  with real values. This is useful because if we keep treating these lines as
  just prefixes, our parser could interpret lines like

    (cherry picked from commit XXXXX

  (missing right earmuff) as a Git-generated trailer because we only look at the
  prefix and not really the entire content.

- (thought experiment, not really todo) Add conformance tests in Rust (property tests)

  - We can be more explicit about the "grammar" of trailers, and then
  check for random input and see that the C algorithm agrees with the
  explicit, higher-level specification defined in Rust (perhaps simply
  using the above regular expression), and make sure that the two agree

  - This way we get the advantage of thinking about things at a higher
  level in Rust, but without having to rewrite existing C code

  - The trailer API uses opaque pointers, so there is virtually no risk
  of "you are not testing the pure C part; your Rust-based tests are
  contaminated too much with the code that marshals/unmarshals structs
  from/to Rust/C" because Rust will have no knowledge of the internals
  of the trailer-related structs (except currently the options struct,
  which could be put behind an opaque pointer as well, if we wanted to
  do fuzzing of that). Rust already knows how to do marshaling
  automatically for C structs though so the options struct could
  probably still remain as a publicly exposed struct.
